# Bio
I am a Singaporean experimental physicist specialising in astroparticle physics. My key research interest is in the direct detection of dark matter, but I am also interested in other aspects of astroparticle physics, such as neutrino astronomy. My research is focused on the application of machine learning, statistics, and quantum sensing technologies to the scientific questions I am interested in. In addition to applying quantum sensing techniques to astroparticle physics, a lot of my work revolves around dual phase xenon time projection chambers.

I am currently a postdoc at Rice University. Before joining Rice, I completed my PhD at Purdue University. See my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8228-8949) for up-to-date information about my publications and latest research.

I am also interested in teaching and outreach. You can find some instructional materials I have created in the [resources](/resources) section. I volunteer with [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org), and I am always happy to hear about outreach opportunities!
