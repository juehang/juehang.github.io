# Useful Resources

Here I list some useful things that I have made over the years, such as visualisations or instructional materials. Unless otherwise stated, all materials are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/); please feel free to use them as you wish!

## Instructional materials

### University-level materials

 - [Annotated Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dBqK96Pk0PY9Usy_YmdfybuMyEF-pbDp?usp=sharing) demonstrating how to conduct a simple peak search in toy particle physics data using HMC/NUTS.
 - [Annotated Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12T2bfFWZ6k2OzBTAq5kyanVQF19wCYia?usp=sharing) demonstrating how to conduct a simple peak search in toy particle physics data with variational inference, referencing the earlier HMC/NUTS notebook. This notebook includes an activity at the end for students to try out, and was originally designed as a classroom activity for a Bayesian statistics lecture.

### Pre-tertiary materials

I occasionally create materials for elementary/primary school students with my (dear) wife, who is an elementary school teacher.

 - [Plant adaptations activity (pdf, dropbox link).](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rhcb8245t5iqeixpss7n2/Garden-activity.pdf?rlkey=ttbqdqqitdcvbvrdykdvbjp9g&dl=0) This worksheet is designed to align with TEKS 4.13.A, though it is quite generic so it should be broadly applicable! In this one-page worksheet, students are asked to identify and explain two plant adaptations in their school garden.
